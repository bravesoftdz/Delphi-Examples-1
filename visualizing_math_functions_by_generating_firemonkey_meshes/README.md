#Visualizing Math Functions By Generating Firemonkey Meshes

At Delphi XE2 Anders Ohisson produced this Example

Abstract: This article discusses how you can generate your own 3-dimensional mesh for visualizing mathematical functions using Delphi XE2 and FireMonkey.

Unfortunately changes to Firemonkey after XE2 trashed the code.

I was looking at similar code and reworked Anders' Code for Berlin. This folder contains my modified code.

For Descriptions etc go to the original paper.
